This is forked from the awesome but much-neglected:
http://code.google.com/p/svg-android/

Changes
=======
* Mavenised.
* Added SVGBuilder to allow for SVG parsing & rendering options.
* ColorFilters can now be applied. IMO this replaces the replace-single-colour
  functionality.
* Fixed SVGParser when running with Robolectric.
* Many great fixes from
  [josefpavlik](https://github.com/josefpavlik/svg-android) and
  [mrn](https://github.com/mrn/svg-android)
